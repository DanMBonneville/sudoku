# sudoku

Hellooo there. I am building this app for fun/educational purposes.

This Sudoku game has been forked from raravi as a vehicle to build out a Cypress testing suite for a React app.
It is containerized with Docker and run in a CI/CD pipeline using a Jenkinsfile.

Additionally this project introduces challanges in synchronicity (not meant for TDD or BDD).
