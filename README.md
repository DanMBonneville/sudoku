# sudoku

A Sudoku game in React!

This game has been forked from raravi as a vehicle to build out a cypress testing suite in accordance with industry standard CI CD and devOps principles.
The cypress suite does not test the code, it just solves the sudoku puzzle.
This is to introduce challanges in Synchronicity while building out the CI CD pipeline in jenkins.
By the end, there will be behavior driven technology in Cucumber, a dockerized environment, and automatic testing.
