# sudoku

Hellooo there. If you see this, please send me your best offer!
This sudoku game has been forked from raravi as a vehicle to build out a cypress testing suite in accordance with industry standard CI/CD and devOps principles. 
The cypress suite does not test the code, it just solves the sudoku puzzle. 

This is to introduce challanges in synchronicity while building out the CI/CD pipeline in jenkins.
There are other aspects to this project such as behavior driven technology in Cucumber and a dockerized environment.
