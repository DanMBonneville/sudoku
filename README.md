# sudoku

Hellooo there. I am building this app for fun/educational purposes.

This sudoku game has been forked from raravi as a vehicle to build out a 
cypress testing suite on a react app that can be 
containerized in Docker and run in a
CI CD pipeline with the Jenkinsfile.

Additionally this project introduces challanges in synchronicity (not menat for TDD or BDD).
